  <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine. Across
    collaborative teams within the Department of Radiology, I study how artificial intelligence can strengthen
    diagnostic imaging and improve care delivery across diverse patient communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also contribute to research at the Department of Radiology at Harvard Medical School/Mass General Hospital and the
    Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, where I work on advanced AI methods in vascular and interventional
    radiology. My goal is to translate responsible machine learning into tools that make healthcare more human-centered,
    equitable, and globally accessible.
